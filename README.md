I applied several quality-of-life patches, as well as some fixes here and there. Note that some of these patches may not apply correctly for a new dwm build, and may need to patch them yourself.
Used with my [nix configuration](https://github.com/png670/nixconf) repo, under `nixos/features/dwm.nix`
# dwm
